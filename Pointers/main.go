	// pointer points to. When we write *xPtr = 0 we are saying “store the int 0 in the memory location xPtr refers to”.
	// If we try xPtr = 0 instead we will get a compiler error because xPtr is not an int it's a *int, which can only be given another *int.

	//Finally we use the & operator to find the address of a variable. &x returns a *int (pointer to an int) because x is an int.

	// needed to eventually delete anything created with new. Go is not like this, it's a garbage collected programming
	// language which means memory is cleaned up automatically when nothing refers to it anymore.
